# Inheritance refers to the interrelation of the classes.
# A class in ruby cannot be related to more than 1 other class, therefore, to the one that is related, its considered the "parent" and the one the "child".
# The child class recieves then the attributes of its parent.
# Pros: dynamic binding and polymorphism

# Composition is a way to assign features of another class to the working class we are in, in a way they are independant.
# Pros: code reuse and higher flexibility.

# Encapsulation is the mechanism by our code implement itself, the working parts doing their jobs.
# Abstraction is how my code works in the way I only show the user what he or she needs to work. My engine is not completely visible.

# Duck Typing means the classes can have the same method name and still work independently 

# The Law of Demeter 
# limited knowledge of the objects and discretion with its relations

# Overriding Methods refers to modifying the behavior that a superclass provide

# Modules means separating the functionality of my program so it can work independently.

# Scope means the reach a function can have.

# Private are needed methods for functionality but are the ones that we wont want the user to see.

# Public Methods are the user visible method he need for the program to run.

# Instance vs Class methods and variables
# Instance are the specific objects created, the can belong to a class, but they are that particular element.
# Class methods are the behaviour of our classes.
# Variables are the outsider elements that are given for the classes and othe objects.


# Polymorphism is the capacity of the code to change functionality.

# Separation of Concerns refers to the separate responsability of each function and the less overlaping the better.
